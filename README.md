<h1>Artify</h1>

Artify allows users to check out their most listened to artists and songs on Spotify. Besides that, it also allows users to generate playlist with song recommendations based on their previous listening experience.
Since Artify is a "fun" project made mainly for school purposes it currently (and indefinitely) does not allow outside users on the website. In order for Spotify to approve usage of their API to non-whitelisted users, I would have to rebrand (since Artify apparently sounds to similar to Spotify), set up a more permanent domain and pray for their approvement. Because I already failed that once and because this is not the only website of this kind I decided to retire the project and move on. The website is still up but only accessible with whitelisted accounts.
